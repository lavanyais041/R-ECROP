		<h3>Welcome to e-Crop Yield Prediction</h3>
		<blockquote >
				Agriculture is a way of life, a tradition, which, for centuries, has
			shaped the thought, the outlook, the culture and the economic life of
			the people of India. Agriculture, therefore, is and will continue to
			be central to all strategies for planned socio-economic development
			of the country. Rapid growth of agriculture is essential not only to
			achieve self-reliance at national level but also for household food
			security and to bring about equity in distribution of income and
			wealth resulting in rapid reduction in poverty levels Getting
			reliable and quick data on crop yields is critical for the government
			to estimate the output of the crop. Global Positioning System (GPS)
			and Smartphone's are used to getting the entire crop-yield
			estimation. Under the process, a government field worker conducting
			the survey by taking the Geo-tagged and time stamped photos on a
			Smartphone's. The Geo-tagging, which recorded the GPS coordinates,
			and time stamping ensured that survey workers were indeed at the
			right place at the right time. A Smartphone app then transferred the
			recorded data-yield, date, time, nature of crop, location of land
			(survey number), and send to centralized server on a near real time
			basis. The uploaded data is used for aggregation and analysis,
			creating a database of different crops, and estimate the future
			prediction of the crop hobli wise and district wise. <br />
